# Agile Handoffs While Building a Node.js App

When working on a full stack Node.js app, one of the most useful habits I discovered is the **Agile handoff**, which is the idea of handing off work to your future self. This practice helps me restart coding faster and avoid wasting time remembering what I was doing.

## Personal Experience

When I was setting up my Node.js app, I installed Express and added nodemon so the server would auto-restart during development. I had to stop partway through my configuration, so before closing my laptop I committed my changes to GitHub with a clear message and left a TODO in the code. The next day, those notes and the commit history made it easy to pick up exactly where I left off without confusion.

## What is an Agile Handoff?
In Agile, a **handoff** means transferring responsibility or knowledge about work from one person to another. This could be between developers, designers, or testers. But Agile handoffs aren’t just about teams, they also matter when you are handing work off to your **future self**.

> “Small, frequent handoffs … because tasks are designed to overlap.” — *Mountain Goat Software*

This kind of handoff light, frequent, and overlapping helps reduce the friction of pausing and resuming work, keeps context fresh, and smooths collaboration.


> Self-handoffs matter because memory fades quickly. A good commit message or TODO can save your future self hours of frustration.

## Why Self-Handoffs Matter
- Reduce wasted time when returning to unfinished work  
- Prevent forgetting key details  
- Make collaboration easier if others need to continue your code

## Practical Tips for Self-Handoffs
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages  
- Use TODOs with context (what’s left and why)  
- Keep a short `RESUME.md` file with steps to run your app locally
